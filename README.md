# Flutur-i5


# Introduction
Flutur i5 is an open-source 3D printer project, created by an enthusiast for the wider maker community. It is designed to inspire and support fellow makers and DIY lovers. The idea behind Flutur i5 is to build a stable, reliable and flexibile 3D printer that is affordable, easy to assemble, operate and modify.

This is a 3D printer featuring a Cartesian-style positioning system, driven by three two-phase stepper motors: belt-driven on the X and Y axes, and lead screw-driven on the Z axis; all guided by linear bearings on Ø12 stainless steel rods. The entire system is assembled into a rigid rectangular (box-type) aluminum frame, made of 20 x 20 mm slot profile members. The printable volume is 285 × 300 × 300 mm (X × Y × Z).

# Bill of Materials (BOM)
The BOM.xls file contains materials with quantities needed for this project. Names of components follow provided assembly drawings. All measures are given in milimeters. 

Printable components could be FDM 3D printed with basic PLA filament, even the hotend plate. Hotend requires active cooling. Both portal plates could be made of acrylics or aluminum.

## 3rd Party Disclaimer

This project is designed to be compatible with certain commercially available components from third-party manufacturers. This project does not distribute, reproduce, or claim ownership of any third-party models. Users requiring detailed technical information, specifications, or official design files of these components, should obtain them directly from the respective manufacturers’ official sources. This project also uses a combination of widely available off-the-shelf components (e.g. standard bearings and fasteners). While references to such parts are made in the design, no third-party models are included in this repository.

The printer can also be realized with other solutions, depending on the builder’s preferences and requirements. In that case, modifications of certain parts may be required, such as adapting or redesigning mounting positions to fit the new hardware.

In this version of the project, control system consist an _MKS Robin Nano v1.2_, together with _TMC2208_ stepper drivers and a _MKS TFT35 v1.0_ display. Motion system is driven by four NEMA17 17HS8401 stepper motors. Power supply must provide at least 360 W. The Flutur i5 project does not provide instructions for wiring or electrical instalation in general. The proper wiring, operation and handling of these components are defined by their respective manufacturers, and their official documentation should be followed.

# Safety and Fire Hazard Disclaimer

3D printers are devices that operate with electricity and heat, and therefore must be considered potentially hazardous. Electrical wiring and installation on this device should only be performed by individuals with the appropriate knowledge and experience. Special attention must be given to all electrical connections, especially joints and connectors.

The author of this project assumes no responsibility or liability for any potential damage, injury, or loss resulting from the reproduction, assembly, or use of this device. All responsibility rests with the builder/user.

Building your own 3D printer can be a fun and rewarding experience, but please remember: safety comes first. Always double-check your wiring, use quality connectors, and don’t leave the printer unattended during operation. Treat this project as both a learning journey and a responsibility — careful assembly and mindful use will make your device safer and more reliable.
